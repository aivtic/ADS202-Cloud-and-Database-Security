## **How to Navigate the Labs**

### **Lab 1: Database Access Control Model (SQL Example)**
In this lab, you'll learn how to implement and manage **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** in a database system using SQL. You'll:
1. Create a sample database and implement user roles with various access levels (Admin, Manager, User, Guest).
2. Use SQL queries to simulate real-world database interactions, ensuring each user role has the appropriate privileges.
3. Implement the **Principle of Least Privilege** to restrict unnecessary access.

This lab will also include sample SQL scripts for creating the database, tables, and assigning privileges.

---

### **Lab 2: Database Access Example**
This lab focuses on **Data Integrity** and **Audit Logging**. You'll:
1. Learn to apply constraints (e.g., `CHECK`) to enforce valid data within your database.
2. Implement triggers to automatically log actions such as updates and deletes to sensitive tables.
3. Use the **Audit Log** technique to track changes and ensure compliance.

By the end of this lab, you'll understand the importance of tracking sensitive operations and how audit logs help detect malicious activity.

### **Cloud Security Labs**

### **Lab 1: Cloud IAM Configuration**
In this lab, you'll learn how to configure **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** roles in cloud environments:
1. Set up IAM roles and assign them to cloud resources (e.g., EC2 in AWS, VM in GCP, etc.).
2. Explore **least privilege** access by defining precise permissions for each role.
3. Implement **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** and **role-based policies** for users and services in your cloud platform.
4. Secure cloud resources through proper IAM role configuration.

---

### **Lab 2: Cloud Security Posture Management**
This lab will guide you through managing and monitoring the **security posture** of your cloud environment:
1. Learn about **cloud security best practices** and tools used by major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).
2. Implement security policies, configure encryption, and manage vulnerabilities.
3. Use tools like **AWS Security Hub**, **Google Cloud Security Command Center**, and **Azure Security Center** to monitor and improve the security of your cloud environment.
4. Understand how to implement **continuous monitoring** to ensure ongoing security.

## **Additional Information**

- **Cloud Labs**: For Cloud Security labs, you may need access to cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Ensure that your account is set up with the appropriate permissions to perform tasks such as IAM configuration and resource management.
  
- **Lab Tools**: You will be using database management tools such as MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or command-line tools for SQL. For Cloud Security labs, tools like AWS CLI, GCP Console, or Azure Portal will be required.

- **Lab Completion**: Make sure to complete the labs in sequence as the concepts build on each other. Start with database security and move to cloud security to get a holistic view of securing modern infrastructures.
